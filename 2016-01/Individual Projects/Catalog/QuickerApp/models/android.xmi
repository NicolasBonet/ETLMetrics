                <items value="Light infantry forces form a skirmish line to slow the enemy advance and keep their own line unmolested by enemy skirmishers. Whether they are called light infantry, jaegers, tirailleurs or chasseurs &#xe0; pied, it is the job of these men to screen the main battle line, harass the enemy and, if possible, pick off important men in the enemy&#x2019;s ranks. Unlike their fellows in the line infantry, light infantrymen are trained to think for themselves, use the ground and cover intelligently, and not fight in rigid lines. Instead, they form a loose skirmish line and fire independently at their own designated targets. The effect is a constant, low-level barrage rather than the crashing thunder of a volley but the effect is quite deadly as officers and sergeants are picked off and removed from the fight. Against cavalry, however, their best defence is to withdraw to their own battle line. Historically, the Austrians were widely regarded as producing the finest light infantry forces in Europe. Other nations did catch up, but in the case of Britain and France it was their experiences in fighting in North America that persuaded them of the wisdom of light troops. Battle lines were simply impossible to manage in the dense woodlands, and largely pointless against the native tribes!"/>

                <items value="The janissaries are professional soldiers, hardened by arduous training and given the best equipment in the army. As a force, they are the cream of the Ottoman army but, in comparison to some other nations, they fight in a slightly old fashioned way. This is small comfort to those who stand against them, as the janissaries are personally brave to the point of foolhardiness. They are also given to festooning themselves with weapons and hurling themselves into any fray! Historically, the corps of janissaries (the term means &#x201c;new soldiers&#x201d;) dates back to the 14th Century. They were intended to replace the unreliable ghazi tribal warriors with a force indoctrinated to be completely loyal to the Sultan. This was achieved by taking boys as young as five for training and conversion to Islam if required. The janissaries had their own corps of engineers, supply troops and were even paid regularly, whether they were at war or not! Over time, however, they came to be used as bureaucrats and administrators, and this gave them too much power over the Ottoman Empire. Eventually, the janissaries&#x2019; entrenched position in government became arrogance and an entrenched position against change, and so helped the Ottomans to stagnate and decline."/>

Able to afford excellent armour and swords, they can punish most other infantry. These units along with archers form the backbone of many English armies."/>
