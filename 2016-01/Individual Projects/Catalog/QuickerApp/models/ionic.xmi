        <articles title="PrussianJaegers" subTitle="Prussian Jaegers" content="Light infantry forces form a skirmish line to slow the enemy advance and keep their own line unmolested by enemy skirmishers. Whether they are called light infantry, jaegers, tirailleurs or chasseurs &#xe0; pied, it is the job of these men to screen the main battle line, harass the enemy and, if possible, pick off important men in the enemy&#x2019;s ranks. Unlike their fellows in the line infantry, light infantrymen are trained to think for themselves, use the ground and cover intelligently, and not fight in rigid lines. Instead, they form a loose skirmish line and fire independently at their own designated targets. The effect is a constant, low-level barrage rather than the crashing thunder of a volley but the effect is quite deadly as officers and sergeants are picked off and removed from the fight. Against cavalry, however, their best defence is to withdraw to their own battle line. Historically, the Austrians were widely regarded as producing the finest light infantry forces in Europe. Other nations did catch up, but in the case of Britain and France it was their experiences in fighting in North America that persuaded them of the wisdom of light troops. Battle lines were simply impossible to manage in the dense woodlands, and largely pointless against the native tribes!" image="http://wiki.totalwar.com/images/8/88/Pru_i_euro_prussia_jaeger_info_infr.png" portraitImage="http://wiki.totalwar.com/images/8/88/Pru_i_euro_prussia_jaeger_info_infr.png"/>
        <articles title="Landwehr" subTitle="Landwehr" content="Landwehr soldiers are armed with muskets and bayonets, and are quite capable of defending their homes. They are also equal to the job of quelling troublesome civilians, but their lack of training means that they should not be expected to fight as well as regular soldiers. These are the people-in-arms, not a hardened force of veterans. Against well-handled and disciplined soldiers, they will suffer heavy losses. They are, however, a useful force of garrison troops, and can help keep order at relatively low cost. In 1812 Prussia had been compelled to aid Napoleon&#x2019;s invasion of Russia. General Yorck, the officer in charge of the Prussian Auxiliary Corps, was a well-respected patriot, and an experienced soldier. It was obvious to him that the French were going to be defeated, so he declared his corps neutral and aided the Russians in taking East Prussia. As East Prussia, if not the whole country, was at war with France, an army was needed to defend it and the result was the recruitment of a large body of Landwehr militia. Yorck&#x2019;s decision to defy the French produced the Russo-Prussian alliance of 1813, a significant bloc against Napoleon&#x2019;s France." image="http://wiki.totalwar.com/images/d/d3/Ntw_prussia_inf_militia_prussian_landwehr_info.jpg" portraitImage="http://wiki.totalwar.com/images/d/d3/Ntw_prussia_inf_militia_prussian_landwehr_info.jpg"/>

        <articles title="Steamship" subTitle="Steamship" content="A demi-cannon is a heavy artillery piece from the previous century, deployed in a fixed battlefield position. Although obsolete, a demi-cannon is still a dangerous weapon to face as it fires a ball with a nominal weight of around 24 pounds. This large calibre makes for a large weapon with a massive gun carriage. Once properly emplaced, a demi-cannon is hard enough to adjust for aim, let alone drag to a new location! Originally, this lack of tactical mobility was not a problem, as the gun was for siege work or for a battlefield where there was little artillery present. It was unlikely to ever suffer any kind of counter-battery fire, so didn&#x2019;t need to be moved. Artillery was sometimes incredibly dangerous to its users as well as the targets: fire was a terrible risk. The artillery baggage train usually held an enormous quantity of powder, and any stray spark was liable to cause an explosion. Anyone out of place caught near the powder train could expect little mercy: some generals ordered that enemy agents should be burned alive if caught in an arson attempt, and immediate lynching for their own errant soldiers wandering too near the artillery train!" image="http://wiki.totalwar.com/images/8/8b/Etw_i_steamer2.png" portraitImage="http://wiki.totalwar.com/images/8/8b/Etw_i_steamer2.png"/>
        <articles title="Hussars" subTitle="Hussars" content="Hussars are light cavalry, used as skirmishers and for scouting ahead of an army. These superb horsemen are a force that can be used as a screen by the main army, or for strategic scouting to locate the enemy. They are armed with curved sabres and smoothbore carbine muskets. Their gaudy, almost popinjay uniforms should not lead enemies to underestimate them as mere dandies &#x2013; these are trained, disciplined and dangerous soldiers. Hussars have a certain swashbuckling attitude towards the business of warfare, and the bandit origins of the Hungarian &#x201c;husz&#xe1;rok&#x201d; are certainly evident. Even non-Hungarian hussars cultivate a slightly barbarous air, and little private or enemy property is safe when they are around! Oddly, they are also unusually democratic, and troopers expect to be consulted by their officers before attacking the enemy, again probably a legacy of their brigand heritage. Historically, many nations adopted hussars after the Austrian type proved successful, and military fashions were also influenced by the hussars&#x2019; splendid and elaborate uniforms. Hussar uniforms became slight caricatures, but remained very fashionable and popular, particularly with ladies &#x2013; perhaps it was the very tight breeches that were so appealing." image="http://wiki.totalwar.com/images/f/fa/Etw_i_euro_hussars_info_cavs.png" portraitImage="http://wiki.totalwar.com/images/f/fa/Etw_i_euro_hussars_info_cavs.png"/>

For all its smoke and noise, handling the smoothbore, muzzle-loading musket can be taught to all but the most stupid of men. Once the basic skills of loading have been mastered, it is simply a matter of pointing the loud end at the enemy and pulling the trigger. It is in God&#x2019;s hands as to what happens next! Even the most inexperienced or cack-handed of peasants can be useful with a musket in his hands. The noise of a volley is often enough to frighten, and any casualties in the enemy ranks are a bonus. Historically, such units of irregular musket men would arrive at a battlefield with all kinds of weapons, from ancient matchlocks handed down from father to son, to modern government-issue weapons looted from the enemy dead. This lack of standardisation did not matter much, as it was the ability to fire at all that made the unit a useful force." image="http://wiki.totalwar.com/images/a/a1/Ott_i_east_ethnic_musketmen.png" portraitImage="http://wiki.totalwar.com/images/a/a1/Ott_i_east_ethnic_musketmen.png"/>
