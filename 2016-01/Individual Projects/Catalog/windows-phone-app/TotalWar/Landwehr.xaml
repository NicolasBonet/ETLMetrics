<TextBlock TextWrapping="Wrap" Text="Landwehr soldiers are armed with muskets and bayonets, and are quite capable of defending their homes. They are also equal to the job of quelling troublesome civilians, but their lack of training means that they should not be expected to fight as well as regular soldiers. These are the people-in-arms, not a hardened force of veterans. Against well-handled and disciplined soldiers, they will suffer heavy losses. They are, however, a useful force of garrison troops, and can help keep order at relatively low cost. In 1812 Prussia had been compelled to aid Napoleon’s invasion of Russia. General Yorck, the officer in charge of the Prussian Auxiliary Corps, was a well-respected patriot, and an experienced soldier. It was obvious to him that the French were going to be defeated, so he declared his corps neutral and aided the Russians in taking East Prussia. As East Prussia, if not the whole country, was at war with France, an army was needed to defend it and the result was the recruitment of a large body of Landwehr militia. Yorck’s decision to defy the French produced the Russo-Prussian alliance of 1813, a significant bloc against Napoleon’s France." FontFamily="Lato" FontSize="16" Margin="0,0,-0.167,0"/>
