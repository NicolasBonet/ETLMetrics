# 2016-01 Project
This project was made by all the students of the lecture in which they had to make a transformation-chain which had as an input a MySQL query and they had to convert it into Java code doing CRUD functions.

# Project Specification
Students had to build a grammar to parse SQL queries that represented an schema of a Marketplace, the model generated by XText was the input of their transformation-chain where an array of ETL files should convert that SQL Model into a Java Model. Later, another group of EGL files converted said model into Java code which should be able to create a database (based on SQLite) respecting the original schema, generate all CRUD operations of each entity from the schema and generate all tests. An skeleton of the target application was given to student, but all ETL and EGL files were developed by them.

# Grades
To get an idea of the quality of each implementation we've provided the grades obtained from each group:


|Group    |Grade|
|---------|-----|
|Group 1  | 2.8 |
|Group 2  | 4.4 |
|Group 3  | 0.7 |
|Group 4  | 0.0 |
|Group 5  | 1.9 |
|Group 6  | 4.6 |
