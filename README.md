# Folders description

In each folder, you can find the following sub-folders:
* "Individual Projects" where the students propose the problem and solution. Thus, each project is different from others and we've provided a description to give you an idea about the developed transformations.
* "Group Projects" includes the projects where the professor states a common problem and the students propose a solution.

In 2015-02, two different problems have been stated by the professor: "Blog2Calendar" and "Marketplace2SQL", a description of each one is provided with a readme.

In 2016-01, the problem stated by the professor was "SQL2Java", a description was also made explaining the context.
