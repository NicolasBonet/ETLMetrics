# ETLMetrics
We've organized some of the projects made by students on this repository the structure is the following:

## 2015-02
These are projects made by students on the 2015-02 term, we have a set of "Individual Projects" each one in that folder is different an we've provided a description to give you an idea about what their transformations do. The folder called "Group Projects" includes two different context which were implemented by all our students, the first one is "Blog2Calendar" and the second one "Marketplace2SQL", a description of each one is provided with a readme.

## 2016-01
Here are the projects made from Jan-May from the current year, we also have "Individual Projects" which are implementations for different contexts, a description was added explaining the main idea of each project. There is also a "Group Projects" folder in which students implemented a "SQL2Java" application, a description was also made explaning the context.
